/* This is a hack file. If you are reading me in anticipation of having to add to me,
leave your ego at the door and prepare to stoop to a level you always told yourself
in coder's finishing school you never would.

I am here because when I was created we had a need to override parts of the Drupal 8
editor interface but couldn't justify a full blt -> webpack -> sass build system. Someday,
that may change. Someday, the apes may rise up. Someday, all computers may be named after
Old Spice anti-perspirant flavors.

Dear future reader, I have just one question for you. Do people still keep peanut butter in
the fridge or has it finally become punishable by death? */
